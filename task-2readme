Sure! Here's a **README** (without any code) for the simplified **Web Application Vulnerability Scanner**:

# 🔍 Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

## 📖 Overview

This is a lightweight Python-based tool designed to help security testers and developers identify common vulnerabilities in web applications, specifically:

* **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

The scanner works by sending crafted payloads to URL parameters and form inputs, then analyzing the server's response for signs of vulnerability.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Detects basic SQLi and XSS vulnerabilities
* Scans both URL parameters and HTML forms
* Uses simple payload-based testing
* Fast, minimal, and easy to run from the command line
* No external dependencies beyond `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `requests` library
* `beautifulsoup4` library

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **URL Parameter Testing**
   Sends SQLi and XSS payloads via URL query parameters and checks if the response contains reflections of the payload (indicating a possible vulnerability).

2. **Form Testing**
   Detects all input forms on the target page, submits them with test payloads, and checks if the payloads are reflected in the server response.

---

## 🛡️ What It Detects

* **SQL Injection**: Looks for reflections or error messages triggered by common SQL payloads.
* **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Detects if scripts are reflected unsanitized in the server's response.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

* Security testing of web apps in development or staging environments
* Educational demonstrations of common web vulnerabilities
* Quick initial vulnerability check before deeper analysis
