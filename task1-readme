Sure! Here's a **README (without code)** that explains what the tool does, how to use it, and what each part means:

# 🛡️ File Integrity Checker

## 📖 Overview

The File Integrity Checker is a lightweight Python tool designed to monitor and ensure the integrity of files and directories. It does this by generating and comparing cryptographic hash values (SHA-256) to detect if any files have been **modified**, **deleted**, or **added**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Scans individual files or entire directories.
* Generates secure SHA-256 hash values.
* Saves hashes in a local JSON file.
* Detects file changes by comparing current state to saved hash records.
* Minimal, fast, and easy to use.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* Python 3.x (no external libraries needed)

---

## 📂 How It Works

1. **Scan Mode (`scan`)**

   * Calculates the hash of each file.
   * Saves all file paths and hashes into a JSON file (`hashes.json`).

2. **Check Mode (`check`)**

   * Recalculates current file hashes.
   * Compares them with previously stored hashes.
   * Reports:

     * Modified files
     * Missing (deleted) files
     * New files not present in the original scan

---

## 🕹️ Usage

1. Run the script in **scan** mode to generate and save the initial file hashes.
2. Later, run the script in **check** mode to detect changes.

---

## 🔐 Why Use It?

* Detect tampering in important files.
* Monitor configuration or source code directories.
* Keep track of sensitive or critical system files.
* Lightweight alternative to complex security software.

---

## 📎 Notes

* The hash record (`hashes.json`) must be kept safe. If it's modified or deleted, comparisons won't be accurate.
* Only tracks content changes, not metadata like timestamps.
